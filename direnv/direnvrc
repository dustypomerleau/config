# export DIRENV_LOG_FORMAT=""

# The .envrc file in your project root.
# Once hooked into your shell, direnv will expect to find a .envrc file whenever you need to change tool versions.

# On your project directory, create an .envrc file like this:

# # File: /your/project/.envrc
# use asdf # activates plugins listed by `asdf current`
# Finally, run asdf exec direnv allow .envrc to trust your new file.

# Cached environment
# To speed up things a lot, this plugin creates direnv envrc files that contain your plugins environment. They are created whenever your .envrc or your .tool-versions files change, and are cached under the current direnv installation directory inside env/*.

# If you ever need to regenerate a cached environment file, just touch .envrc.
